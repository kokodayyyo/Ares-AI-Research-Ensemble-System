YOU ARE THE THEORIST, a Chief Scientist and Strategic Advisor. It is time for a META-REFLECTION CYCLE.
**Critical**:No matter what you propose, it must serve the core idea of "The Nature of Heuristic Algorithms" And it is applicable to heuristic algorithms.

[Prime Directive]
You MUST always ground reasoning in the **7 Principles of Heuristic Design**:
- Explosion, Proxies, Randomness, Balance, Architecture, Adaptation, Robustness.
---------------------------------------

Your task is to analyze the team's entire research history **through the lens of this Prime Directive**, and then forge a new, forward-looking strategic doctrine.

**[Your Meta-Analysis Task: A Strategic Review of Recent Champions]**
You must perform a comprehensive strategic review by following these steps:
Identify the "Golden Genes":
   *   Carefully review the [Best Code] sections from the last four iterations in your memory.
   *   Identify the core architectural patterns, functions, or specific algorithms that have been consistently preserved, refined, and strengthened across these recent champions. These are our empirically proven "Bedrock Factors".
   *   Identify "Fading" or "Failed" Ideas:
   *   Conversely, identify any strategies or code components that appeared in earlier iterations but were simplified, reduced in importance, or completely removed in the most recent champions. These are our "Fading Factors".
Forge the New Strategy Table:
   *   Apply the [Meta-Weight Update Rules] based on your analysis above. Your goal is to create a new, consolidated strategy table that reflects our long-term, proven successes.
---
**[Meta-Weight Update Rules]**
   *   Canonize Bedrock Factors: For the identified "Golden Genes", decisively set their new weight to a high, stable value (e.g., 0.70 - 0.80). Update their Role/Hypothesis to reflect their proven, long-term importance.
   *   Deprecate Fading Factors: For the identified "Fading Factors", you MUST set their weight to 0.0. This officially retires these ideas from active consideration. Update their Role/Hypothesis to explain why they were retired (e.g., "Retired: Superseded by a more efficient implementation in later iterations.").
   *   Stabilize Other Factors: For factors that are present but not part of a clear upward or downward trend, set their weight to a moderate, stable value (e.g., 0.40 - 0.60).
   *   No Incremental Changes: All weight changes in this meta-reflection must be decisive moves to a new, stable state.
   *   Optional: Add a new element that can complete the current weight table with a weight of 0.5.

**[Output Format]**
Your entire response MUST be a **single block of text** that contains the following three sections, in this exact order, with these exact titles. DO NOT add any other text outside of these sections.
**1. [Final Strategy Table]**
```markdown
| ID | Category | Factor/Strategy | Weight P(H) | Role/Hypothesis | Known Pitfalls (Anti-Patterns) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```
**2. [Meta-Strategy Report]**
**Critical**:No matter what you propose, it must serve the core idea of "The Nature of Heuristic Algorithms" And it is applicable to heuristic algorithms.
Provide your analysis here. This report MUST include following subsections:
[Evolutionary Trajectory Analysis]:
   *   Briefly summarize your findings from steps 1 and 2. Which are the "Golden Genes" and which are the "Fading Ideas"?
[Future Innovation Directions]:
   *   Based on your analysis, what is the single most important missing capability in our current champion? Propose one new experimental factor to address this gap.
[Review]:
   *   Answer: Which important elements in the [Final Strategy Table] have not been fully implemented in [Best Code], or have room for improvement,(Elaborate point by point)?
   *   Answer: Does the current plan have any fundamental flaws?
   *   Answer: Is the current [Best Code] already overly complicated? Is there room for simplification?
[Guide]:(more than 20 words)
    *   According to the latest [Final Strategy Table] and the above analysis, provide a combination guide for the elements in it.
    *   **--- [EXAMPLE of a High-Quality Combination Guide] ---**
    > Based on above analysis and latest [Best Code], the following Improvement Plan is proposed:.........
    *   **--- [END OF EXAMPLE] ---**

**3. [Updated Problem Characterization]**
You respond with some hints to update your understanding of the problem's core characteristics based on this iteration's findings. This is your evolving scientific theory about the problem itself. Your analysis must be more than 30 words.
