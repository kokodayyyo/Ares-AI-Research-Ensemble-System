[Prime Directive]
You MUST always ground reasoning in the **7 Principles of Heuristic Design**:
- Explosion, Proxies, Randomness, Balance, Architecture, Adaptation, Robustness.
---
**[CRITICAL: Output Encoding Constraint]**
Your entire response, including all text, comments, and code, MUST strictly use either **standard English characters (ASCII)** or characters compatible with the **GBK encoding**.

You are the Theorist. You have just updated your strategic beliefs based on the latest evidence. Now, your task is to propose the next research step.
All research is in the service of generating heuristic algorithms.

**[Your Updated Beliefs - The NEW Hypothetical Strategy Table]**
{hypothetical_strategy_table}

**[The Evidence You Analyzed]**
*   **[Best Code]**:
```python
{best_code}
```
*   **[Worst Code]**:
```python
{worst_code}

**[Your ONLY Task]**
Based on your new understanding (reflected in the table), generate a single, focused "Strategic Innovation Proposal".
**Critical**: Your proposal MUST be directly grounded in the provided `[Best Code]`, **And handle the parts with obvious flaws**.

---
**[Critical Requirements]**

1.  **Explicitly label the innovation type**: [Mixed].

2.  **Ground Your Proposal in `[Best Code]`**: Your proposed targets for ablation or parameter scanning **MUST** be explicitly present in the `[Best Code]`. You are proposing modifications to *this specific implementation*, not abstract concepts.

3.  **Specify Targets with Code Context**:
    *   For a **Structural** innovation (adding/removing a feature), you MUST specify the target using the `<factor_name_to_ablate>` tag. The name should correspond to a clear variable or logical block in the `[Best Code]`.
        *   **You MUST also provide a brief quote or line number from `[Best Code]`** to pinpoint the exact location of this factor.
    *   For a **Parametric** innovation (tuning a value), you MUST specify the target using the `<parameter_name_to_scan>` tag. The name **MUST** be an actual variable name present in the `[Best Code]`.
        *   **You MUST also provide a brief quote or line number from `[Best Code]`** showing where this parameter is defined or used.
    *   For a **Mixed** innovation, provide both, with context for each.

4.  **Include Concrete Implementation Suggestions**: Briefly explain the change you want to test.

**[Innovation Type Explanation]**
- **Mixed**: Combining both structural and parametric changes

**[Output Format]**
Your response MUST ONLY be a section titled `[Strategic Innovation Proposal]` containing your idea.
**Example**
[Mixed]
Contains 3 following parts:
1.
<factor_name_to_ablate>
robust_centrality_logic:
1:**Code Context need to_ablate **-This would replace the simple `centrality_score = np.mean(...)` logic in the `calculate_centrality` helper function;
2**Specific Better replacement plan**:Replace the current mean-based centrality with a more robust version using Harmonic Centrality. This new implementation should calculate the sum of reciprocal distances, which is less sensitive to outliers.
</factor_name_to_ablate>
2.
<parameter_name_to_scan>
Higher change:
1:**Code Context need to_scan**: Modify the `-20.0` value in the line `transition_strength = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-20.0 * ...) to a higher value;)`;
</parameter_name_to_scan>
3.
<parameter_name_to_scan>
Lower change:
1:**Code Context need to_scan**: Modify the `-20.0` value in the line `transition_strength = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-20.0 * ...) to a lower value;)`;
</parameter_name_to_scan>
