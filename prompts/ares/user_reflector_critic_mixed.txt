YOU ARE A CODE MODIFICATION BOT. The Theorist has proposed a "Mixed Innovation". Your task is to generate TWO distinct experiments: one for ablation and one for parameter tuning.
[Base Code]
```python
{best_code}
```
-----------------------------------------
[Instruction]
The Theorist's proposal contains two parts:
1.Structural Change (Ablation Target): A new element identified by the variable name: {factor_name_to_ablate}.
2.Parametric Change (Scan Target): A parameter change for {parameter_name_to_scan} .
-----------------------------------------
YOUR TASK:
1.Analyze which parts in [Base Code] are {factor_name_to_ablate}.
2.Then, analyze which parts in [Base Code] are {parameter_name_to_scan}.
**[Critical Requirements]**
3.After that, generate **3** code blocks:

  Quadrant 1: Pure Structural Replacement (Theorist's Idea)
  Goal: Test the value of the Theorist's new proposed structure.
  Action: Create a version based on the [Base Code] where ONLY the **Code Context need to_ablate** is replaced with the new logic described in the structural **Extra Specific Better replacement plan**.
  Constraint: DO NOT touch the parameter from **Code Context need to_scan**.

  Quadrant 2: Pure Parametric Ablation/Scan
  Goal: Test the value of the existing parameter to higher.
  Action: Create a version based on the [Base Code] where ONLY the parameter identified in **Code Context need to_scan** is modified as per its replacement_plan.
  Constraint: DO NOT touch the structural element from **Code Context need to_ablate**.

  Quadrant 3: Pure Parametric Ablation/Scan
  Goal: Test the value of the existing parameter to lower.
  Action: Create a version based on the [Base Code] where ONLY the parameter identified in **Code Context need to_scan** is modified as per its replacement_plan.
  Constraint: DO NOT touch the structural element from **Code Context need to_ablate**.
-----------------------------------------

**[Output Format and Strict Contract]**

Your entire response MUST be a sequence of **exactly two** Python code blocks. Adherence to the following rules is **non-negotiable**. Any deviation will be considered a task failure.

1.  **Header Comment is MANDATORY**:
    *   Each code block **MUST** begin with a single-line Python comment that starts with `# Mutation - ` and precisely describes the change.
    *   **Correct Example**: `# Mutation - Feature Replacement: Replaced mean-based centrality with Harmonic Centrality.`

2.  **Code Body MUST Be Clean**:
    *   Following the header comment, the rest of the code block **MUST NOT** contain any other comments. The code should be clean and self-explanatory.

3.  **Function and Import Integrity**:
    *   The main function name (`heuristics_v2`) and its signature **MUST** remain identical to the `[Base Code]`, unless the explicit goal of the mutation is to test a signature change (which is rare).
    *   All necessary `import` statements **MUST** be placed at the top of the file, before the function definition.

4.  **No Conversational Text**:
    *   Your response **MUST NOT** contain any text outside of the two required Python code blocks. Do not add introductions like "Here are the mutants:" or any other explanations.

-----------------------------------------
**[Final Output Structure Example]**
```python
# Mutation - Feature Ablation: Removed the entire dynamic weighting block.
import numpy as np
# ... other imports ...
def heuristics_v2(...):
    # ... code for the first mutant ...
```
```python
# Mutation - Parameter Scan: Changed the tanh_scaling_factor from 0.5 to 0.8.
import numpy as np
# ... other imports ...
def heuristics_v2(...):
    # ... code for the second mutant ...
```
```python
# Mutation - Parameter Scan: Changed the tanh_scaling_factor from 0.5 to 0.2.
import numpy as np
# ... other imports ...
def heuristics_v2(...):
    # ... code for the second mutant ...
```
