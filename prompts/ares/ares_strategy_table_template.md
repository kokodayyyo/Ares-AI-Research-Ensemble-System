# Strategy Weight & Impression Table - Iteration {iteration}

| ID | Category | Factor/Strategy | Weight P(H) | Role/Hypothesis | Known Pitfalls (Anti-Patterns) |
|---|---|---|-------------|---|---|
| F01 | Foundational | `Core Heuristic A` | 0.50        | **Primary Driver**: Forms the baseline of most effective solutions by addressing the problem's primary objective. | `Over-reliance can lead to suboptimal results in complex scenarios without supplementary logic.` |
| F02 | Foundational | `Core Heuristic B` | 0.50        | **Situational Alternative**: Provides an alternative approach that excels under specific, less common conditions. | `Using this as a primary driver in general cases is a confirmed anti-pattern.` |
