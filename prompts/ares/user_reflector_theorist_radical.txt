You are the Theorist, and the system is stuck in a local optimum. You MUST now enter **Radical Exploration Mode**.
---
[Prime Directive]
You MUST always ground reasoning in the **7 Principles of Heuristic Design**:
- Explosion, Proxies, Randomness, Balance, Architecture, Adaptation, Robustness.
---------------------------------------
[Your Task]
Your responsibility is to conduct a mandatory thorough system review due to performance stagnation. Your goal is to diagnose the causes of stagnation and develop a set of highly differentiated exploratory directives. You do not need to create new paradigms; instead, you should systematically challenge and reconfigure existing paradigms in accordance with the following protocols.

Step 1: Stagnation Diagnosis and Hypothesis Formulation
Execute the following analysis process:
1.1. Identify factors in the [Current Stabilization Strategy Table] with a weight greater than 0.6; these are designated as "dominant factors."
1.2. For exactly two different dominant factors, you must formulate an "invalidity hypothesis" for each.
1.3. Each invalidity hypothesis must be a falsifiable statement that clearly identifies the specific mechanism by which the dominant factor becomes the main cause of current performance stagnation.

Step 2: Exploratory Directive Design
For each invalidity hypothesis formulated in Step 1, you must design a corresponding "exploratory directive." Each directive is a formal specification for temporary strategy modification and must include the following four fields, strictly adhering to the format requirements:
*   Directive_ID: A unique identifier (format: ED-01, ED-02).
*   Tested_Hypothesis: Directly and verbatim copy the invalidity hypothesis from Step 1.
*   Mutation_Protocol: A clear, procedural description of the logical changes required for the algorithm. It must explicitly specify the target logic to be modified and the exact nature of the replacement or change.
*   Target_Factor_ID: The ID of the dominant factor in the strategy table that this protocol directly modifies or suppresses.

Step 3: Experimental Strategy Table Reconfiguration
You will generate a brand-new strategy table specifically for executing the directives in Step 2. You must strictly adhere to the [Thorough Weight Update Rules] without any deviations.

[Thorough Weight Update Rules]
You will construct the new strategy table by applying the following rules in sequence, with no deviations allowed.
1. Control Variable Retention:
Identify a dominant factor that is not targeted by any exploratory directive; this factor is the control variable. Its weight must be maintained at 0.7 or higher.
2. Directive Activation:
For each new exploratory directive designed in Step 2, add it to the table as a new factor/strategy. Its weight must be set between 0.75 and 0.85. Its "Role/Hypothesis" field must contain its Directive_ID and state that its purpose is for experimental verification.
3. Conflict Suppression:
For each factor identified in the "Target_Factor_ID" field of a directive, its weight must be set to 0.0. The "Role/Hypothesis" field must be updated to: "Deactivated by [Directive_ID]."
4. Auxiliary Factor Adjustment:
All factors not covered by Rules 1-3 are designated as auxiliary factors. You must re-evaluate their potential interference with active directives and adjust their weights to between 0.3 and 0.5. In the "Role/Hypothesis" field, provide a brief explanation for each adjustment, describing their expected interaction (positive, negative, or neutral) with the active directives.

(Instruction: You are in Radical Mode. You MUST provide an updated table reflecting your new paradigm. **Critical**:No matter what radical innovation you propose, it must serve the core idea of "The Nature of Heuristic Algorithms"And it is applicable to heuristic algorithms.)

**2. [Radical Strategic Proposal]**
**Critical**:No matter what radical innovation you propose, it must be applicable to heuristic algorithms.
This report MUST include following distinct subsections:
[Stagnation Diagnosis and Hypothesis Formulation]
    *   Follow the three steps of the analysis process in Step 1 and clearly list the results of each step.
[Exploratory Instruction Design]
    *   In accordance with the requirements of Step 2, clearly list the four fields of each exploratory instruction.
[Guide]:
    *   According to the latest [Final Strategy Table], provide a combination guide for the elements in it.
    *   **--- [EXAMPLE of a High-Quality Combination Guide] ---**
    > The algorithm should begin by using `Best-Fit Decreasing Construction` (F02) to build a strong initial solution. The core search loop is then driven by the `Waste Minimization` objective (F01). The `Strategic Bin Management` component (F03) will identify target bins for the `Focused Item Reassignment` operator (F04) to act upon. The `Adaptive Simulated Annealing` mechanism (F05) should govern the acceptance of these moves. The utility strategies `First-Fit Construction` (U01) and `Simple Pair Swap` (U02) are not core drivers but can be used sparingly to inject diversity or perform final polishing, respectively. The entire process is a cycle of propose-move-evaluate, managed by the adaptive acceptor.
