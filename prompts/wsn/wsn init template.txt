Design a core function:
Used in Combinatorial optimization:
 This code is a core function in heuristic optimization algorithms, mainly used for updating the positions of Search Agents, helping the algorithm find better solutions in the solution space.
Specifically, its function is: in each iteration, all search agents adjust their positions according to the currently found "best position" (Best_pos).
The function you guide to design can only access the variables in the following template and return the required variables.
Parameters:
        Positions (np.ndarray): Position matrix of search agents, with a shape of (SearchAgents_no, dim),
                               where `SearchAgents_no` is the number of search agents and `dim` is the problem dimension.
        Best_pos (np.ndarray): Current global best position vector, with a shape of (dim,).
        Best_score (float): Current global best score (not directly used in the function, reserved for future extensions or context consistency).
        rg (float): Iteration progress parameter, typically the ratio of the current iteration number to the total number of iterations,
                   with a value range of [0, 1].
        1. Positions (Search Agent Position Matrix):
        - Dimension: dim = number of cluster heads * 3 (e.g., dim = 150 for 50 cluster heads);
        - Coordinates (X/Y, corresponding to the 1st and 2nd dimensions in every 3 dimensions): [0.0, 50.0] (range of physical deployment area);
        - Power (corresponding to the 3rd dimension in every 3 dimensions): [0.0, 30.0] (unit: dBm, meeting the sensor signal strength requirements).

        2. Best_pos (Global Optimal Position Vector):
        - Dimension: Consistent with Positions (dim = number of cluster heads * 3);
        - Coordinates (X/Y): [0.0, 50.0];
        - Power: [0.0, 30.0];
        - Additional constraints: Must be a feasible solution satisfying "full sensor coverage + cluster head connectivity + cluster head capacity <= 15" (no explicit numerical range, but must meet the constraints).

        3. Best_score (Global Optimal Score):
        - Basic range: >= the minimum total power consumption when constraints are satisfied (usually several tens to several hundreds, depending on the cluster head power configuration);
        - Range with penalties: >= 1000 when constraints are not satisfied (due to a connectivity penalty of 1000, with higher penalties after superimpose of coverage/capacity penalties).

        4. rg (Iteration Progress Parameter):
        - Initial value: 2.5 (early exploration);
        - Decay range: [0.1, 2.5] (not lower than 0.1 in the later stage to avoid complete stop of exploration);
        - Stage correspondence: Exploration phase [0.6, 2.5], Optimization phase [0.1, 0.5].


    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Updated position matrix of search agents, with the same shape as the input `Positions`.
