    """
    You have access to a rich scientific computing environment.
    The following core libraries are available and recommended for use:

    import numpy as np
    import math
    import scipy
    import torch

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray):
            A 2D Numpy array of shape (n, n) where `distance_matrix[i, j]`
            is the distance between city `i` and city `j`. `n` is the
            total number of cities.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray:
            An n x n heuristic matrix. The value at `heuristic_matrix[i, j]`
            should represent the desirability of traveling from city `i` to
            city `j`. A higher value indicates a higher desirability. This
            matrix will be used to guide a local search algorithm.
