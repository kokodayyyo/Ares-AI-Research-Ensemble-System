[1. The Nature of the Problem: Core Concepts & Trade-offs]
The Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a challenging NP-hard generalization of the classic knapsack problem.
It revolves around the core conflict between item efficiency (Exploitation) and resource allocation (Exploration).

This heuristic function calculates the desirability of items for a multi-dimensional knapsack problem by considering both the prize-to-weight ratios across dimensions and the capacity utilization constraints.
It normalizes weights by capacity constraints and computes weighted average ratios to prioritize items that offer high value with relatively low resource consumption across all dimensions.
