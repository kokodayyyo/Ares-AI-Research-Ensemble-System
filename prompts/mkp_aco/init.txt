The Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) is a challenging NP-hard generalization of the classic knapsack problem. It revolves around the core conflict between item efficiency (Exploitation) and resource allocation (Exploration).
design a heuristic function that effectively balances these competing demands to guide an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) solver.

def heuristics_v2(prize: np.ndarray, weight: np.ndarray, capacity: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    You have access to a rich scientific computing environment.
    The following core libraries are available and recommended for use:

    import numpy as np
    import math
    import scipy
    import torch

    Args:
        prize (np.ndarray):
            A 1D Numpy array of shape (n,) where `prize[i]` is the value or
            "prize" of item `i`. `n` is the total number of items.

        weight (np.ndarray):
            A 2D Numpy array of shape (n, m) where `weight[i, j]` is the
            cost or "weight" of item `i` in dimension `j`. `m` is the number
            of knapsack constraints (dimensions).

        capacity (np.ndarray):
            A 1D Numpy array of shape (m,) where `capacity[j]` is the maximum
            capacity constraint for dimension `j`.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray:
            A 1D heuristic vector of shape (n,). The value at `heuristic_vector[i]`
            should represent the overall desirability of including item `i` in
            the solution. A higher value indicates a higher desirability. This
            vector will guide an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) solver.
