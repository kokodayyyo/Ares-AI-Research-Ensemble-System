The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a cornerstone NP-hard problem in logistics and operations research. It extends the TSP by adding capacity constraints, creating a complex interplay between path optimization (Exploitation) and customer clustering (Exploration).
Design an independent heuristic function for this problem:
The `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n),
Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n),
and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution.
The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.

    You have access to a rich scientific computing environment.
    The following core libraries are available and recommended for use:

    import numpy as np
    import math
    import scipy
    import torch

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray):
            A 2D Numpy array of shape (n, n) where `distance_matrix[i, j]`
            is the distance between location `i` and `j`. Location 0 is the depot.
            `n` is the total number of locations (depot + customers).

        coordinates (np.ndarray):
            A 2D Numpy array of shape (n, 2) representing the Cartesian
            coordinates (x, y) of each location. `coordinates[i]` gives the
            [x, y] position of location `i`. `coordinates[0]` is the
            position of the depot.

        demands (np.ndarray):
            A 1D Numpy array of shape (n,) where `demands[i]` is the demand of
            customer `i`. `demands[0]` is always 0 for the depot.

        capacity (int):
            The uniform capacity of each vehicle.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray:
            An n x n heuristic matrix. The value at `heuristic_matrix[i, j]`
            should represent the desirability of traveling from location `i` to
            location `j`. A higher value indicates a higher desirability. This
            matrix will guide an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) solver.
