    """
    You have access to a rich scientific computing environment.
    The following core libraries are available and recommended for use:

    import numpy as np
    import math
    import scipy
    import torch

    Args:
        demands (np.ndarray):
            A 1D Numpy array of integers representing the size (or "demand")
            of each item to be packed. For example, `demands[i]` is the
            size of item `i`.

        capacity (int):
            An integer representing the uniform capacity of each bin. All bins
            are identical and have this maximum capacity.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray:
            An n x n heuristic matrix where n is the number of items.
            The value at `heuristic_matrix[i, j]` should represent the
            desirability of placing item `j` into a bin that currently
            contains item `i` (or was the last item placed). A higher
            value indicates a higher desirability.
